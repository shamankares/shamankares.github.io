I am Anindya Sekar Paramitha. I am pursuing a bachelor degree in informatics engineering at Universitas Maritim Raja Ali Haji.

I have created and learned to make some applications and developed communication and teamwork skills in my college time. I am currently improving my skills in backend and frontend development, as well as exploring my passion for game development.

Beside these, there are so many interesting things I would like to explore.

Anyway, please enjoy this picture of my pink squid plushie (the plushie was made by my friend).
